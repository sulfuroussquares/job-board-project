# job-board-project
This project is a job board app which will connect to job board API's and return job postings. 

It utilizes:
- React.js (front end)
- Material (U/I)
- Express Server
- Redis (DB)
- Node worker on Cron to pull jobs from the job board(s)

I'm also utilizing a local Jenkins CI server during this development, which will build upon code pushes.



Credit goes to **freecodecamp** and **Code Drip**, as I am coding along their tutorial.
